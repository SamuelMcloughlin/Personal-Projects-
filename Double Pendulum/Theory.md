# Background Theory
The double pendulum is one of the first introductions to chaotic motion in physics. It is also one of the first systems that highlights the benefit of using mechanics other than Newton's.

Here I will explore solutions of the double pendulum system utilising Newtonian, Langrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to see their computational differences.

## Trial Simple Pendulum

Before we delve into the complexity of the double pendulum, a simple case of the single pendulum is tested.

## Newtonian Mechanics
Whilst the introductory form of mechanics, great complexity arises when considering the double pendulum system using Newtonian Mechanics, having to analyse the forces being applied to both of the pendulums.
